# airbnb_data
Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data to better understand:

How other developers suggested breaking into the field (what education to pursue)?
which month has the most listings ?
which apartment btype has the most listings ?
what relates to price of apartment and how can we predict price ?


File Descriptions
There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
